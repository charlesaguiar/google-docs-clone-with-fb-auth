# REACT/FIREBASE AUTH

This app was built using vite. And also, all the awesomeness of Firebase and TailwindCss! After cloning it, don't forget to run `npm install` to install dependencies. Also, create an `.env.local` file, with the same content as `.env.example`, but with the `XXX`s replaced by your actual Firebase app keys.

## Upcoming:

- More layout stuff;
- Unit tests;
- Google docs clone;
